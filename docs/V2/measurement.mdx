# Recent measurement `/api/v2/measurement`

<PreliminaryWarning />

The `/api/v2/measurement` endpoint allows you to get the most recent measurement from the device. All data points are "optional"; The API does not send data points that are `null` or not available at all. This mostly depends on the connected smart meter. Make sure your application can handle this.

### External devices

Some smart meters have one or more external devices connected to it. This can be, for example, a gas and a water meter. The `external` data point lists these devices and their measurements.
Each entry is supplied with a set of data. See [this example](#hwe-p1-full).

| Data      | Type                     | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| unique_id | String                   | The unique identifier from this device                                                                                                                       |
| type      | String                   | The type of the device, can be `gas_meter` `heat_meter` `warm_water_meter` `water_meter` or `inlet_heat_meter`. Design your application to handle new types. |
| timestamp | [Timestamp](#timestamps) | Timestamp provided by external device, describing when measurement was send                                                                                  |
| value     | Number                   | The raw value                                                                                                                                                |
| unit      | String                   | The unit of the value, for example: "m3" or "GJ"                                                                                                             |

### Timestamps

Timestamps are formatted via a ISO 8601 string (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss`). The timestamp is without timezone information as this is not provided by the device. Example: `"2024-06-28T14:12:34"`.

### Capacity rate (capaciteitstarief) {#capacity-rate}

Belgium users may be charged for the peak usage per month (see <Link to="https://www.fluvius.be/nl/thema/factuur-en-tarieven/capaciteitstarief">capaciteitstarief</Link>). The data points `average_power_15m_w`, `monthly_power_peak_w` and `monthly_power_peak_timestamp` can be used to track the maximum demand.
