# Introduction

With the HomeWizard Energy platform, you can get insights in your energy usage. Use the HomeWizard <Link to="https://www.homewizard.nl/p1-meter">Wi-Fi P1 Meter</Link> to access real-time data directly from your smart meter, the HomeWizard <Link to="https://www.homewizard.nl/energy-socket">Wi-Fi Energy Socket</Link> to get energy insights from all your devices, the HomeWizard <Link to="https://www.homewizard.nl/kwh-meter">Wi-Fi kWh Meter</Link> to measure devices such as solar panels and the HomeWizard <Link to="https://www.homewizard.com/nl/watermeter">Wi-Fi Watermeter</Link> to get insight in your water usage. With the open API you can integrate the data directly into your system of choice.

## HomeWizard Energy API

The HomeWizard Wi-Fi P1 Meter, Wi-Fi Energy Socket, Wi-Fi kWh Meter, and Wi-Fi Watermeter (referred to as "device") each have a local API that allows you to retrieve the latest measurements or control the device. You can access this API as long as you are connected to the same Wi-Fi network as the device and the API is enabled in the HomeWizard Energy app. This API is designed for integrating your device with personal automation, home automation, or data graphing systems. Note that it is not possible to retrieve historical data through the local API, as this data is not stored on the device itself.

## Terms and Conditions

-   **Usage** - The user may not directly or indirectly use the HomeWizard Energy API to sell, lease, loan or generate a revenue from a product, system or software using the API
-   **Support** - The usage of the HomeWizard Energy API is officially supported by HomeWizard, however HomeWizard can not supply customer service regarding the implementation of the API in your own or third party applications.

-   **HTTPS** - Your data is securely transmitted.
-   **Always available** - No need to turn on the API in the app.
-   **Authorization** - Only the devices you trust can access the API.
