# Introduction.

With the HomeWizard Energy platform, you can gain insights into your energy usage. Use the HomeWizard <Link to="https://www.homewizard.com/p1-meter/">P1 Meter</Link> to access real-time data directly from your smart meter, the HomeWizard <Link to="https://www.homewizard.com/energy-socket">Energy Socket</Link> to get energy insights from all your devices, the HomeWizard <Link to="https://www.homewizard.com/kwh-meter">kWh Meter</Link> to measure devices such as solar panels, and the HomeWizard <Link to="https://www.homewizard.com/watermeter">Water Meter</Link> to gain insights into your water usage. With the open API, you can integrate the data directly into your system of choice.

## HomeWizard Energy API.

The HomeWizard P1 Meter, Energy Socket, kWh Meter, Watermeter, and Plug-In Battery (referred to as "device") each have a local API that allows you to retrieve the latest measurements or control the device. You can access this API as long as you are connected to the same Wi-Fi network as the device and the API is enabled in the HomeWizard Energy app. This API is designed for integrating your device with personal automation, home automation, or data graphing systems. It is not possible to retrieve historical data through the local API, as this data is not stored on the device itself.

## Terms and Conditions.

-   **License** - The HomeWizard Energy API is licensed, not sold. HomeWizard grants the user a non-exclusive license (with no right to sub-license) to the HomeWizard Energy API for personal, non-commercial use.
-   **Usage** - The user may not directly or indirectly use the HomeWizard Energy API to sell, lease, loan or generate a revenue from a product, system or software using the API
-   **Support** - The usage of the HomeWizard Energy API is officially supported by HomeWizard, however HomeWizard can not supply customer service regarding the implementation of the API in your own or third party applications.

## API v2.

The HomeWizard Energy API is moving to v2, which is a more secure and feature-rich version of the API. In v2 of the API, we have added the following features:

-   **HTTPS** - Your data is securely transmitted.
-   **Always available** - No need to turn on the API in the app.
-   **Authorization** - Only the devices you trust can access the API.
-   **WebSocket support** - Get real-time push-based updates.

Read more about the [new version of the API here](/docs/category/api-v2).

## First Steps.

To understand the basics of the API, you can read the [getting-started](/docs/getting-started) guide and explore [v1](/docs/category/api-v1) or [v2](/docs/category/api-v2) to learn about all the available features.

## Devices and API Versions {#devices}.

The following table shows which devices are supported by the API and which API version they support.
