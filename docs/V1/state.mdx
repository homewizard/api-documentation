# Control Device State (`/api/v1/state`)

The `/api/v1/state` endpoint returns the actual state of the Energy Socket.

This endpoint accepts `GET` and `PUT` requests.

-   With `GET` you will receive the actual state
-   With `PUT` you can control the state.

## Parameters

| Data        | Type   | Description                                                                  |
| ----------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| power_on    | Bool   | The state of the switch. Returns `true` when the relay is in the 'on' state. |
| switch_lock | Bool   | When set to `true`, the socket cannot be turned off.                         |
| brightness  | Number | Brightness of LED ring when socket is 'on'. Value from 0 (0%) to 255 (100%). |

## Examples

### Get Actual State

This response tells that the socket is 'on', switch-lock is 'off' and the brightness of the LED ring is set to maximum.

```http title="Request"
curl http://<IP ADDRESS>/api/v1/state
```

```http title="Response"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
   "power_on": true,
   "switch_lock": false,
   "brightness": 255
}
```

### Turn on Socket

```http title="Request"
curl http://<IP ADDRESS>/api/v1/state \
   -X PUT \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{"power_on": true}'
```

```http title="Response"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
   "power_on": true
}
```

### Turn on Switch-lock

After enabling `switch_lock`, the socket is 'on' and cannot be turned off until `switch_lock` is disabled.

```http title="Request"
curl http://<IP ADDRESS>/api/v1/state \
   -X PUT \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{"switch_lock": true}'
```

```http title="Response"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
   "switch_lock": true
}
```

### Set Multiple Parameters

You can configure multiple parameters at the same time. In this example.

-   Socket is turned off.
-   Switch-lock is turned off.
-   Brightness is set to 127 (50%).

The order of a combined request does not matter, if `switch-lock` was on, the socket will still turn off.
The complete state has to make sense; It is not possible to set `power_on` to false and `switch_lock` to true. See [error handling](/docs/v1/error-handling) for more details.

```http title="Request"
curl http://<IP ADDRESS>/api/v1/state \
   -X PUT \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{"power_on": false, "switch_lock": false, "brightness": 127}'
```

```http title="Response"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
      "switch_lock": false,
      "power_on": false,
      "brightness": 127
}
```
