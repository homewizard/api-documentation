# Discovery

The energy devices can be automatically discovered on your network, the method used for this is <Link to="https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/server/know-how/multicast-dns/">Multicast DNS</Link> (also called `mDNS`, `Zeroconf` or `Bonjour`). Your application can use this technology to discover the device(s) without the user having to enter the IP address.

## Example scan

The device can be found on the `_hwenergy._tcp` domain.

```
   $ dns-sd -B _hwenergy._tcp .
   Browsing for _hwenergy._tcp
   DATE: ---Wed 13 Oct 2021---
   14:51:03.565  ...STARTING...
   Timestamp     A/R  Flags  if Domain  Service Type     Instance Name
   14:51:03.566  Add      3   7 local.  _hwenergy._tcp.  energysocket-AABBCC
   14:51:03.566  Add      3   7 local.  _hwenergy._tcp.  energysocket-DDEEFF
   14:51:03.566  Add      3   7 local.  _hwenergy._tcp.  energysocket-001122
   14:51:03.566  Add      3   7 local.  _hwenergy._tcp.  p1meter-334455
   14:51:03.566  Add      3   7 local.  _hwenergy._tcp.  kwhmeter-667788
   14:51:03.566  Add      3   7 local.  _hwenergy._tcp.  watermeter-ABCDEF
```

The hostname is formatted as `<product-name>-<last 6 characters of serial>`, so devices with serial `AABBCCDDEEFF` the hostname is as following:

| Device                   | Example hostname    |
| ------------------------ | ------------------- |
| P1 meter                 | p1meter-DDEEFF      |
| Energy Socket            | energysocket-DDEEFF |
| Watermeter               | watermeter-DDEEFF   |
| kWh meter (single phase) | kwhmeter-DDEEFF     |
| kWh meter (three phase)  | kwhmeter-DDEEFF     |

## TXT records

A discovery response contains some extra data that can be used to improve the setup in your application.

| Data         | Description                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| api_enabled  | '0' or '1', reflects if the API is enabled (1 means enabled)                                                                                               |
| path         | Fixed to '/api/v1'. Can be used to validate that your application supports this device and API version                                                     |
| serial       | Serial, also the MAC address. Consists of 12 hexadecimal values                                                                                            |
| product_name | A fixed, user-friendly name. This name is not the same that is set by the user in the app.                                                                 |
| product_code | The product type, see [Supported devices](/docs/getting-started#supported-devices). Make sure your application can handle other values for future products |
