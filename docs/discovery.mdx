# Discovery

Energy devices can be automatically discovered on your network using <Link to="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6762">Multicast DNS</Link> (also known as `mDNS`, `Zeroconf`, or `Bonjour`). This technology enables your application to discover devices without requiring the user to know the IP address.

## Services

Devices can broadcast one or two services on the network, depending on the available API version(s) of this device:

-   `_hwenergy._tcp` - to discover devices that are using API v1 over HTTP
-   `_homewizard._tcp` - to discover devices that are using API v2 and later over HTTPS

## `_hwenergy._tcp`

This service is used to discover devices that are using **API v1**, which uses HTTP (port 80). Devices with API v1 are available on the `_hwenergy._tcp` service.

### TXT Records

A discovery response contains additional data to enhance the setup in your application.

| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| api_enabled  | Indicates if the API is enabled. The API is disabled when set to `0` and enabled when set to `1`. See [how to enable the API](/docs/getting-started.mdx#enabling-the-api). |
| path         | Set to `/api/v1`. Can be used to verify that your application supports this device and API version.                                                                        |
| serial       | Device serial number, also used as the MAC address. This unique value per device consists of 12 hexadecimal characters.                                                    |
| product_name | A user-friendly name that may change at any time.                                                                                                                          |
| product_type | The product type; refer to [supported devices](/docs/getting-started#supported-devices). Your application should support additional values for future products.            |

## `_homewizard._tcp`

This service is used to discover devices that are using **API v2 and later**, which uses HTTPS (port 443). Devices with this API version are available on the `_homewizard._tcp` service.

Run the following command to discover devices on your network: `dns-sd -B _hwenergy._tcp .`

```
   $ dns-sd -B _hwenergy._tcp .
