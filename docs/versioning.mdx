# Versioning and updates

## Firmware updates

The energy devices are updated automatically when a new version is available.
When an update is available, it will be gradually rolled out to the devices. As a result, not all devices may have the latest version.

The versioning scheme is `(xx)X.YY` (eg. `2.03` or `12.34`).
