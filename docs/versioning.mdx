# Versioning and Updates

## Version Scheme

The HomeWizard Energy API follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), with the version number structured as `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. The v1 API only uses the `MAJOR` version, while the v2 API uses both `MAJOR` and `MINOR`.

-   `MAJOR` version updates signal incompatible changes in the API.
-   `MINOR` version updates add backward-compatible features or enhancements.
-   `PATCH` version updates provide backward-compatible bug fixes.

### Backward Compatibility

The HomeWizard Energy API is designed for backward compatibility, aiming to avoid breaking changes. When a breaking change is necessary, the `MAJOR` version number will increase, while the original API remains accessible. See [Requesting a Specific API Version](#requesting-a-specific-api-version) for more information.

An older version remain available as long as feasible, but may be removed at any time. To stay informed, [subscribe to updates](/docs/changelog#subscribe-to-updates).

### Example

1. **Version `1.0.0`** (aka v1) is current version of the v1 API.
2. At some moment, **version `2.0.0`** is released out of beta. Version `1.0.0` remains available.
3. **One year post `2.0.0` release**, version `1.0.0` becomes deprecated. It will remain available as long as feasible but may be removed at any time.

:::info
Version `2.0.0` is not released for all devices so **no deprecation date** is set yet.

## Requesting a Specific API Version

To ensure your integration remains stable, you can specify an API version. This allows device updates without affecting your application's functionality. We recommend using this feature only if updating your application to the latest API version is challenging.

### Version `1.0.0`

API Version `1.0.0` (v1) can be accessed **over HTTP** via `/api/v1` endpoints. No additional headers are required for version selection. Only Version 1 is supported over HTTP.

### Version `2.0.0` and higher

API Version `2.0.0` (v2) and above are available **over HTTPS** via `/api` endpoints. To request a specific version, include the `X-Api-Version` header in your request, specifying the desired `MAJOR` version number.

### Examples

The examples below demonstrate how to request specific API versions, assuming the current API version is `3.0.1`.

#### Example 1: Version Not Specified

If no version is specified, the latest version is used by default.

```http title="Request"
curl https://<IP ADDRESS>/api/measurement --insecure \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>"
```

```http title="Response"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Api-Version: 3.0.1

...
```

#### Example 2: Specified Version

Requesting an older major version (in this case, Version 2) still available within the supported range.

```http title="Request"
curl https://<IP ADDRESS>/api/measurement --insecure \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" \
  -H "X-Api-Version: 2"
```

```http title="Response"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Api-Version: 2.0.5

...
```

Requesting the latest major version (Version 3).

```http title="Request"
curl https://<IP ADDRESS>/api/measurement --insecure \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" \
  -H "X-Api-Version: 3"
```

```http title="Response"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Api-Version: 3.0.1

...
```

#### Example 3: Unsupported Version Requested

In this request, Version 1 is requested over HTTPS, which is unsupported.

```http title="Request"
curl https://<IP ADDRESS>/api/measurement --insecure \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" \
  -H "X-Api-Version: 1"
```

```http title="Response"
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
X-Api-Version: 3.0.1

{"error": "request:api-version-not-supported"}
```
