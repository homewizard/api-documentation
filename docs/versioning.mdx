# Versioning and updates

## Firmware updates

The energy devices are updated automatically when a new version is available.
When an update is available, it will be gradually rolled out to the devices. As a result, not all devices may have the latest version.

The versioning scheme is `(xx)X.YY` (eg. `2.03` or `12.34`).

:::tip Updates
Go to Settings > Meters > (Your device) > `...` (top right) and press 'Check for updates' to check for an update.

Do not ask HomeWizard to update your device. Updates are installed automatically and support cannot update the device for you.

## API version

The API is currently fixed to version `v1`. The version is updated when the a new version contains (possible) breaking changes. The version will be unchanged when non breaking changes, such as new features, new endpoints or stability improvements are introduced.
