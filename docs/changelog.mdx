Added documentation about the `api/v1/identify` endpoint.

[Identify](/docs/endpoints/api-v1-identify) for more information.

### 2022-10-19

Data points in `api/v1/data` are now optional. This means that the fields in [Recent measurement](/docs/endpoints/api-v1-data)` won't be send if the data does not exists at all.
This is -for example- possible in the P1 meter; Missing data in the telegram is not send in the API. This allows us to send new additional data more easily.

See [Recent measurement](/docs/endpoints/api-v1-data)` for more information.
