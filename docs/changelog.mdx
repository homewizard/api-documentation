## API Changelog.

### v1

Feature development of the v1 API has been stopped. No new features will be added to the v1 API. Only critical bug fixes will be applied. We recommend you to upgrade to the v2 API as soon as possible, as the v1 API will be removed in the future.

### v2

-   **2.0.0** - 21-01-2025 - Initial release of the v2 API.
-   **2.0.1** - 30-01-2025 - An issue has been resolved where `energy_import_kwh` and `energy_export_kwh` values in the Plug-In Battery [Measurement API](/docs/v2/measurement#plug-in-battery-hwe-bat) were returning invalid values. The values are now the same as those in the HomeWizard Energy app.
-   **2.1.0** - 01-05-2025 - Support has been added to the P1 Meter to control the Plug-In Battery group mode. See [Plug-In Battery API](/docs/v2/batteries) for more information. This feature is currently in beta.
