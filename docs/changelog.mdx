## API Changelog.

### v1

Feature development of the v1 API has been stopped. No new features will be added to the v1 API. Only critical bug fixes will be applied. We recommend you to upgrade to the v2 API as soon as possible, as the v1 API will be removed in the future.

### v2

#### 2.0.0 - 21-01-2025

- Initial release of the v2 API.

#### 2.0.1 - 30-01-2025

- An issue has been resolved where `energy_import_kwh` and `energy_export_kwh` values in the Plug-In Battery [Measurement API](/docs/v2/measurement#plug-in-battery-hwe-bat) were returning invalid values. The values are now the same as those in the HomeWizard Energy app.

#### 2.1.0 - 01-05-2025

- Support has been added to the P1 Meter to control the Plug-In Battery group mode. See [Plug-In Battery API](/docs/v2/batteries) for more information.

#### 2.2.0 - 01-12-2025 (in beta)

- You can now set charge and discharge permissions for the Plug-In Battery group via the `permissions` field in the [Plug-In Battery API](/docs/v2/batteries). See the documentation for more information.
- A new field has been added to `api/batteries`: `battery_count`, which indicates the number of connected Plug-In Batteries.
- When `target_power_w` field in `api/batteries` is updated, it is now pushed over WebSocket connections as well.
